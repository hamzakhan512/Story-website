        <h1>The Fox And Grapes</h1>
        <p>One hot summer day, a fox was walking through a vineyard. As he strolled along, he noticed a bunch of ripe, juicy grapes hanging from a vine high above him. His mouth watered at the sight of the delicious-looking fruit.

            Determined to have them, the fox jumped up to grab the grapes, but they were just out of his reach. He jumped again and again, trying different angles, but each time he failed to reach the grapes.
            
            Exhausted from his efforts and realizing that he could not reach the grapes, the fox finally gave up. He walked away with his nose in the air, saying to himself, "Those grapes are probably sour anyway."</p>
            <h3>Moral of the story: It's easy to despise what you cannot have.</h3>
