        <h1>The Honest WoodCutter</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a poor but honest woodcutter. Every day, he went into the forest to chop wood, which he would then sell to earn a living.

            One day, while chopping a tree near a river, his axe slipped from his hands and fell into the water. The river was deep, and the woodcutter couldn't retrieve his axe. He sat on the bank of the river and wept, as his axe was his only means of earning a livelihood.
            
            Suddenly, a beautiful fairy appeared before him. She asked, "Why are you crying, good woodcutter?"
            
            The woodcutter explained his predicament, "I dropped my only axe into the river, and now I cannot chop wood to earn my living."
            
            The fairy felt sorry for him and decided to help. She disappeared into the river and soon emerged with a golden axe. "Is this your axe?" she asked.
            
            The woodcutter replied, "No, that is not my axe."
            
            The fairy disappeared again and came back with a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" she asked.
            
            Again, the woodcutter replied, "No, that is not my axe."
            
            The fairy disappeared into the river once more and returned with the woodcutter's old, worn-out iron axe. "Is this your axe?" she asked.
            
            The woodcutter's face lit up with joy, "Yes, that is my axe!"
            
            The fairy was impressed by the woodcutter's honesty. "Because you are an honest man and did not lie, I will give you the golden and silver axes as well," she said.
            
            The woodcutter was overjoyed and thanked the fairy for her kindness. He went back to the village with all three axes and told everyone about the fairy's generosity and the reward he received for his honesty.
            
            From that day on, the woodcutter continued to work hard and live honestly. He became a respected and prosperous man, always remembered for his integrity.</p>
            <h3>Moral of the story: Honesty is the best policy.</h3>
