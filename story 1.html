        <h1>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h1>
        <p>In a village nestled at the foot of a mountain, there lived a mischievous boy who tended the village sheep. To entertain himself, he would often cry out, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!"

            Hearing his cries, the villagers would drop their work and run to help him chase away the wolf. But every time they arrived at the pasture, they found no wolf. The boy would laugh at their frustration, enjoying the attention he received.
            
            One day, feeling bored again, the boy decided to play the same trick. "Wolf! Wolf!" he shouted with all his might. Once more, the villagers rushed to his aid, only to find him laughing heartily and no wolf in sight.
            
            As time passed, a real wolf actually did appear in the pasture, drawn by the bleating of the frightened sheep. The boy, seeing the wolf approach, cried out in terror, "Wolf! Wolf! Help! The wolf is here!"
            
            This time, however, the villagers ignored his cries, thinking it was another prank. They said to each other, "He's fooled us before. We won't be fooled again." The boy pleaded desperately for help, but no one came to his aid.
            
            Tragically, the wolf attacked the sheep, and many of them were killed or injured. The boy learned a harsh lesson that dayâ€”that lying and deceiving others only leads to trouble and loss.
            
            From then on, no one trusted the boy's words, even when he spoke the truth. His foolish pranks had cost him the villagers' trust and the sheep he was supposed to protect.</p>
            <h3>Moral of the story: Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth.</h3>
