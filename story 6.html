        <h1>The Fox And Crow</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, a crow found a delicious piece of cheese and flew up to a branch to enjoy her meal. As she settled on the branch, a sly fox passing by saw her and immediately began to plot how to get the cheese for himself.

            "Good day, Mistress Crow," said the fox in his most charming voice. "How well you are looking today. How glossy your feathers; how bright your eye. I am sure your voice must surpass that of all other birds, just as your beauty does. Let me hear just one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds."
            
            The crow, flattered by the fox's compliments and eager to show off her voice, opened her beak and let out a loud "Caw!" As she did so, the piece of cheese fell from her beak and landed on the ground.
            
            Quick as a flash, the fox snapped up the cheese and began to eat it. "Thank you, Mistress Crow," he said with a grin. "In exchange for your cheese, I will give you a piece of advice: Never trust a flatterer."
            
            The crow, now wiser but much hungrier, flew away, vowing to be more cautious in the future.</p>
            <h3><b>Moral of the story: Beware of flatterers.</b></h3>
