        <h1>The Tortoise And The Hare</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a forest, a hare was boasting about his speed. He bragged about how he could run faster than anyone else and laughed at the slow-moving tortoise. Tired of the hare's arrogance, the tortoise challenged him to a race.

            The hare, amused by the challenge, agreed to race the tortoise. All the animals in the forest gathered to watch. The fox was chosen to be the judge and mark the start and finish lines.
            
            As soon as the race started, the hare sped off, leaving the tortoise far behind. Confident of winning, the hare decided to take a nap halfway through the race. "The tortoise is so slow, I have plenty of time to rest," he thought to himself.
            
            Meanwhile, the tortoise continued to plod along steadily. He didn't stop, nor did he get distracted. He kept moving toward the finish line with determination.
            
            After a long nap, the hare woke up and saw the tortoise was only a short distance from the finish line. He dashed off as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise crossed the finish line just before the hare could catch up.
            
            All the animals cheered for the tortoise, celebrating his victory. The hare hung his head in shame, realizing that his overconfidence and laziness had cost him the race.</p>
            <h3>Moral of the story: Slow and steady wins the race.</h3>
