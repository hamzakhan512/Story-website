        <h1>The Thirsty Crow</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, during a hot summer day, a crow became extremely thirsty. He flew over fields and trees searching for water, but he could not find any. The sun was blazing, and the heat was unbearable, making his thirst even worse.

            Finally, after a long search, the crow spotted a pitcher lying under a tree. He swooped down and peered inside the pitcher. To his delight, there was some water at the bottom. However, the water level was too low, and his beak couldn't reach it.
            
            The crow thought hard about how he could drink the water. He tried tipping the pitcher over, but it was too heavy. He was about to give up when he noticed some pebbles lying around. An idea struck him.
            
            The crow started picking up the pebbles one by one and dropping them into the pitcher. With each pebble he dropped, the water level rose a little higher. He continued this process patiently and tirelessly. Slowly but surely, the water level reached the brim of the pitcher.
            
            Finally, the crow could drink the cool, refreshing water. He drank to his heart's content, quenching his thirst. Feeling satisfied and relieved, the crow flew away, happy and content.</p>
