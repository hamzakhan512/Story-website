        <h1>The Greedy Dog.</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a dog who was very greedy. One day, while wandering around the village, he found a large juicy bone. Excited and overjoyed with his find, he held the bone tightly in his mouth and trotted back home.

            On his way, he had to cross a small wooden bridge over a stream. As he was crossing the bridge, he looked down into the water and saw his own reflection. Thinking it was another dog with a bigger bone, his greedy nature took over.
            
            He wanted that bone too. Without a second thought, he barked at the "other dog" to scare it away and grab its bone. But as soon as he opened his mouth to bark, the bone he was holding fell into the water and sank to the bottom.
            
            The greedy dog was left with nothing. He stood on the bridge, staring at the water, realizing his foolishness and feeling very sad.</p>
            <h3>Moral of the story: Greed can lead to loss.
