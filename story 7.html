        <h1>The Lion And Mouse</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a mighty lion. One day, after a large meal, the lion felt very tired and decided to take a nap under the shade of a big tree. As he lay down and began to snore, a little mouse came out to play.

            The mouse ran up and down the lion's body, having a grand time, until it accidentally woke the lion. The lion, startled and angry, caught the tiny mouse under his large paw.
            
            "How dare you disturb my sleep!" roared the lion. "I shall kill you and eat you!"
            
            The frightened mouse pleaded for its life. "Please, mighty lion, spare me! If you let me go, I promise to help you someday."
            
            The lion laughed at the idea of a tiny mouse helping him, but he was amused by the mouse's bravery. "Very well," he said, lifting his paw. "You may go."
            
            Days passed, and the mouse continued living its life, grateful for the lion's mercy. One day, the lion was out hunting and got caught in a hunter's net. He roared and struggled to free himself, but the more he tried, the tighter the net became.
            
            Hearing the lion's roars, the mouse quickly ran to the scene. Seeing the lion trapped, the mouse said, "Don't worry, my friend. I'll help you." The mouse began to gnaw at the ropes of the net with its sharp teeth. Bit by bit, the mouse made a hole large enough for the lion to escape.
            
            Once free, the lion looked at the tiny mouse with gratitude. "Thank you, little friend," said the lion humbly. "You saved my life today. I laughed at the idea that you could help me, but now I see that even a small creature can be of great help."
            
            The lion and the mouse became good friends, and they lived happily in the forest, helping each other whenever they could.</p>
