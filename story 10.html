        <h1>The Bundle of Sticks</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a village, there lived an old man with his three sons. The old man was worried about their constant quarreling and lack of unity. One day, he called his sons to him and gave each of them a stick.

            "Break it," he instructed. Each son easily broke the stick in his hands.
            
            Then the old man tied three sticks together into a bundle and handed it to his eldest son. "Try to break this bundle now."
            
            The eldest son tried with all his strength, but he couldn't break the bundle of sticks. He passed it to his younger brothers, but they too failed to break it.
            
            The old man smiled and said, "My sons, do you see how easily the single sticks broke? And how strong the bundle is? Just like these sticks, you are weak when you are divided, but together, you are strong and unbreakable."
            
            The sons understood their father's wisdom. From that day on, they stopped quarreling and worked together to solve their problems and support each other. They realized that unity was their strength.</p>
            <h3>Moral of the story: Unity is strength.</h3>
