        <h1>The frog Prince.</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful princess. She loved to play with her favorite golden ball near a deep, dark well in the royal gardens. One day, while tossing the ball up in the air, she missed catching it, and it fell into the well with a splash. The princess peered into the well, but it was so deep that she couldn't see the bottom.

            Distraught, the princess began to cry. Suddenly, she heard a croaking voice. "Why are you crying, princess?" She looked around and saw a small green frog sitting at the edge of the well.
            
            "I've lost my golden ball down the well, and I can't get it back," she sobbed.
            
            The frog thought for a moment and said, "I can help you retrieve your ball, but what will you give me in return?"
            
            The princess, eager to have her ball back, promised, "You can have anything you wantâ€”my jewels, my crown, even half my kingdom!"
            
            The frog replied, "I don't want any of those things. But if you promise to be my friend, let me eat from your plate, and let me sleep on your pillow, then I will fetch your ball."
            
            The princess thought the frog's request was silly, but she agreed, thinking he would never actually come to the palace. The frog dove into the well and soon returned with the golden ball in his mouth. The princess was overjoyed, took the ball, and ran back to the palace, forgetting all about the frog.
            
            That evening, as the princess sat down to dinner with her father, the king, there was a knock at the door. When the servant opened it, the frog hopped in and explained what had happened. The king, hearing the story, told his daughter, "A promise is a promise. You must keep your word."
            
            Reluctantly, the princess allowed the frog to eat from her plate. Later, when it was time for bed, the frog said, "I want to sleep on your pillow." The princess was disgusted, but she carried the frog to her room and placed him on the pillow beside her.
            
            As she lay there, feeling angry and sad, she thought about the frog's kind gesture of retrieving her ball. In a moment of compassion, she gently kissed the frog on his head. Suddenly, the frog transformed into a handsome prince.
            
            The prince explained that he had been cursed by an evil witch and only a kiss from a princess could break the spell. The princess and the prince became good friends, and eventually, they fell in love and married.
            
            They lived happily ever after, ruling the kingdom with kindness and fairness.</p>
